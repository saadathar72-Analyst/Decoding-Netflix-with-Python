## 🧩 Steps Performed  
1. **Data Understanding** – explored dataset structure, shape, and column info.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values and inconsistent data.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – examined patterns in release years, genres, and countries.  
4. **Visualization** – plotted charts for better understanding.  
5. **Insights & Conclusion** – summarized key findings.
